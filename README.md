# CISC 225 Resources

Here you will find resources for your course in Computer Organization.
Links and resource may be updated throughout the semester as needed.

## Textbook

The textbook for the course is
*x86-64 Assembly Language Programming with Ubuntu* by Ed Jorgensen.
This is a free book available from various online sources and is included
in this repository.

## Template Repositories for Codespaces

This template repository sets up a *Codespaces* environment for building and
debugging NASM programs. The *Run/Debug* function includes two build options;
one to build a NASM file with no libraries,
and one to build a NASM file and link with the C library.
*Run/Debug* builds the file that is currently open in the editor and
(if successfully built) runs the program under the control of the
symbolic debugger.

This template repository sets up a *Codespaces* environment for building and
debugging a project involving multiple NASM and/or C source files.
The *Run/Debug* function builds the project, assembling all .asm files and
compiling all .c files, and links with the C library, then (if successfully
built) runs the program under the control of the symbolic debugger.

## ASCII Chart

Here you will find an ASCII chart for reference of character encodings.

## C's *printf* and *scanf* Documentation

Some programming assignments will use the C programming language (not C++).
Input and output in C is done using functions *scanf* and *printf*
respectively (there is no *cin* or *cout* in C).
Here is documentation for those functions.

- [https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/scanf/](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/scanf/)

## NASM Documentation

Programming assignments for the course will involve the NASM assembly language.
Here is a link to the NASM manual. This is complete with regard to NASM and,
as such, is probably overkill for our course. It is provided here for your
reference.

General information about NASM can be found on the NASM web site.
